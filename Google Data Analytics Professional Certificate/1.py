Data is a collection of facts. This collection can include numbers, pictures, videos, words, measurements, observations, and more. 
Once you have data, analytics puts it to work through analysis. 

Data analysis is the collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions,...
and drive informed decision-making. And it doesn't stop there. 
Data evolves over time which means this analysis or analytics, as we call it, can give us new information throughout data's...
...entire life cycle. Data is everywhere. You use and create data everyday.
